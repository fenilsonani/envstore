## ❌ FAILING TESTS (28 tests)

### 1. Integration Tests - API Endpoints (19/19 - 100% failing)
**Root Cause**: `fetch` is mocked but returns undefined
```
× POST /api/auth/signup - should create a new user
× POST /api/auth/signup - should reject duplicate email
× POST /api/auth/signup - should reject short passwords
× POST /api/auth/signup - should handle invalid JSON
× POST /api/auth/login - should login with valid credentials
× POST /api/auth/login - should reject invalid credentials
× POST /api/auth/login - should reject non-existent user
× POST /api/auth/login - should require both email and password
× POST /api/auth/logout - should logout successfully
× GET /api/v1/kv/health - should return health status with valid API key
× GET /api/v1/kv/health - should reject without API key
× GET /api/v1/kv/health - should reject with invalid API key
× POST /api/v1/env/upload - should reject without project
× POST /api/v1/env/upload - should validate input schema
× GET /api/v1/env/latest - should require authentication
× GET /api/v1/env/latest - should validate query parameters
× Rate Limiting - should enforce rate limits on auth endpoints
× Security Headers - should include security headers
× Security Headers - should not expose sensitive information in errors
```
**Error**: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'json'/'status'/'headers')`

### 2. Unit Tests - JWT Management (4/4 - 100% failing)
**Root Cause**: JWT signing requires Uint8Array, not string
```
× JWT Token Management - should create a valid JWT token
× JWT Token Management - should verify a valid token
× JWT Token Management - should reject expired tokens
× JWT Token Management - should reject tokens with wrong secret
```
**Error**: `payload must be an instance of Uint8Array`

### 3. Unit Tests - Crypto Decryption (2/2 - 100% failing)
**Root Cause**: Decryption operation failing
```
× decryptString - should decrypt encrypted data correctly
× Encryption Security - should handle large data efficiently
```
**Error**: `The operation failed for an operation-specific reason`

### 4. Unit Tests - Email Validation (1/1 - 100% failing)
**Root Cause**: Test logic error
```
× Input Validation - should validate email format
```
**Error**: `expected true to be false`

### 5. Performance Tests - HTTP Requests (2/2 - 100% failing)
**Root Cause**: `fetch` is mocked but returns undefined
```
× Response Time Tests - should respond to health check under 200ms
× Response Time Tests - should handle concurrent requests efficiently
```
**Error**: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'status')`

## 🔧 FIXES REQUIRED

### Priority 1: Fix fetch mocking in tests
- Integration tests need proper fetch mocking or a test server
- Consider using `msw` (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking
- Or run tests against actual dev server

### Priority 2: Fix JWT token tests
- Convert secret to Uint8Array properly:
```javascript
const secret = new TextEncoder().encode('test-secret');
```

### Priority 3: Fix crypto decryption tests
- Issue with WebCrypto API in test environment
- May need to use Node.js crypto instead of WebCrypto in tests

### Priority 4: Fix email validation test
- Logic error in test assertion (expecting invalid email to be false)

### Priority 5: Setup proper test environment
- Configure test database connection
- Setup test environment variables
- Consider using test containers for database
